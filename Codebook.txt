Clay Raine class project: February 22, 2015: Getting and Cleaning Data course

Guide to the Variable Names (i.e. Columns) in My Project

Subject.Number 
This column is of the integer class.
Each participant in the study was assigned a number before being assigned to a test or training group. This class project required all subjects to be merged in a single data set, so, all subject numbers appear in the first column of that combined master set.

Activity 
This column is of the factor class.
Each participant was measured performing one of six activities. In the merged master set, these activities are represented by the names given by UC Irvine in the original data files:
•	Walking
•	Walking_Upstairs
•	Walking_Downstairs
•	Sitting
•	Standing
•	Laying

Columns 3 through 81 have column names
provided by the original “features.txt” data file.

All of these variables are of the numeric class.

Each name is a combination of descriptive elements containing each of the following types of information:
•	Which measurement device was used, the accelerometer (“Acc”) or gyroscope (“gyro”), and the calculation that was performed:
o	Mean
o	Standard deviation
o	Mean frequency  
•	Further, the names may contain identifiers of a particular motion (e.g. “jerk”) that was being measured.
